See if GCD can be replaced with Binary GCD with somehow avoiding overflow problems of the version found in the references document.
Binomial/inverse binomial transform like in superseeker
Berlekamp-Massey to solve for rational functions
Linear algebra to solve P-recursive directly with limited parameters? Can't find better algorithms.
Possibly Petkovseks algorithm for hypergeometric functions to simplify P-recursive results?
Transforms from https://akc.is/hops/language/
Check if Newton iteration makes sense in the discrete case
